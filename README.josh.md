# Joshua Osei - Notes

I have setup a simple express server to be able to see the results via your browser of choice.

Pull down the repo run "npm i" and then you are good to start the node application.

Please ensure your version of node is <16.

## npm start

To start the express server.

There are 2 end points for the two tasks.

<http://localhost:3000/task-1>
<http://localhost:3000/task-2>

The above endpoints should give you the results.

These will also be added into the original read me as instructed.
