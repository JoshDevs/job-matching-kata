# Job matching Kata

## Task 1

In the `data` folder of this repo there is a CSV file called `reactions.csv`. It contains real data corresponding to how users on Otta have reacted to (saved or skipped) jobs on the platform.

The reaction data consists of four columns:

- `user_id` - the integer ID of the user who liked or disliked the job
- `job_id` - the integer ID of the job the user interacted with
- `direction` - whether the user liked (`true`) or disliked (`false`) the job
- `time` - the timestamp corresponding to when they reacted to the job

**Task**: The similarity score between two users is the number of jobs which they both like. Find the two users with the highest similarity.

**Answer**: Users `5193` and `1791` have the highest similarity score of `181`.

## Task 2

In the `data` folder there is an additional CSV file called `jobs.csv`. It contains unique integer IDs for over 12,000 jobs, along with integer IDs for the job's associated company.

**Task**: The similarity score between two companies is the number of users who like at least one job at both companies. Using both the `reactions.csv` and `jobs.csv` data, find the two companies with the highest similarity score.

**Answer**: Company `92` and `46` have the highest similarity score of `104`.
